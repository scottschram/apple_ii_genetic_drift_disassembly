# Genetic Drift -- Tools

## Source Recovery

The primary deliverable (`genetic_drift_source.s`) is produced by `tools/annotate_genetic_drift_final.py`, which transforms raw deasmiigs machine output into clean annotated 6502 assembly.

### Command

```bash
python tools/annotate_genetic_drift_final.py
```

**Input:** `disassembly/genetic_drift_annotated.s` (7,064 lines of raw machine output)
**Output:** `genetic_drift_source.s` (clean annotated source)

### What It Does

1. Strips all machine analysis noise (register liveness, stack annotations, optimization hints)
2. Replaces 59 raw hex addresses with named zero-page equates
3. Injects HOW/WHY block comments before 67 functions
4. Documents 28 data tables with structure and purpose
5. Labels 32 subroutine calls with descriptive names
6. Converts misinterpreted instructions in data regions to HEX blocks
7. Replaces tautological soft-switch comments with meaningful descriptions

## Sprite Extraction

Genetic Drift uses pre-shifted HGR sprites with pointer tables in the binary.
The sprites were extracted using `extract_sprites.py` from the Rosetta v2 toolchain.

### Command Used

```bash
python misc/genetic_drift_fork/extract_sprites.py \
    "archaeology/games/action/Genetic Drift (Broderbund 1981)/extracted/GENETIC DRIFT#064000" \
    --ptr-lo 0x25A5 --ptr-hi 0x2646 \
    --width-tbl 0x26E7 --height-tbl 0x2788 \
    --count 32 --base 0x37D7 --ascii \
    "archaeology/games/action/Genetic Drift (Broderbund 1981)/graphics/"
```

### Pointer Tables (file offsets, not memory addresses)

| Table | Offset | Count | Purpose |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| Sprite address low | $25A5 | 32 | Low bytes of sprite data pointers |
| Sprite address high | $2646 | 32 | High bytes of sprite data pointers |
| Width table | $26E7 | 32 | Byte width of each sprite (pixels/7) |
| Height table | $2788 | 32 | Height in scanlines |

### Sprite Format

Each sprite is stored as a pre-shifted bitmap for the Apple II HGR display.
There are 7 shift copies of each sprite (one for each bit position within
the HGR byte). The game selects the appropriate pre-shifted copy based on
the screen X coordinate modulo 7.

Byte layout per sprite: width * height bytes, row-major, left-to-right.
The high bit of each byte is the HGR palette select bit.

### Extracted Sprites

32 sprites total, including:
- Score digits 0-9
- Text sprites ("SCORE", "GENETIC", "DRIFT")
- Directional arrow sprites
- Alien evolution stages (multiple forms)
- Heart projectiles
- Satellite
